# Detroit-Crime-And-Home-Sales
An analysis of crime and home sales in Detroit, MI.

Data from: https://datadrivendetroit.org/

and from: https://data.detroitmi.gov/

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

*****Update as of 12/13/2020: I will be uploading a few new excel files shortly, along with some python files analyzing house sale price and crime
by both zip code and trends over time. 

There are several Tableau images in this repo. Those were created for illustration purposes only. The first image shows the number of violent
crimes vs. the average sale price. This includes all counties in Detroit for which I had data for both. The second image shows the sum of the
sale price of homes as the primary dimension and the number of violent crimes as the secondary dimension. 

The "Detroit Data (stata and eviews ...)" excel file has regression outputs from both stata and eviews. This was an attempt 
at using zip code as a categorical variable to determine if the number of violent crimes impacted the selling price of houses. 
I would not use this approach again but I chose to include it for the benefit of anyone interested. As per the above update, 
I am working on a better way to look at this data.
